# File Upload System Setup Guide

## 1. Run the SQL Setup

Execute the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of supabase_storage_setup.sql
```

This will create:
- `student_records` table with RLS policies
- `student-records` storage bucket
- Storage policies for secure file access

## 2. Features Implemented

### ✅ File Upload System
- **File Types**: PDF, DOC, DOCX (max 10MB)
- **Categories**: Result, Certificate
- **Security**: Row-Level Security ensures users only see their own files
- **Storage**: Files stored in Supabase Storage with user-specific folders

### ✅ Components Created
- `FileUploadForm.tsx` - Upload form with drag & drop
- `FileList.tsx` - Display uploaded files with download/delete
- `fileUploadService.ts` - Service for file operations
- `fileUpload.ts` - TypeScript types

### ✅ Integration
- **Student Dashboard**: File upload section added
- **Lecturer Dashboard**: File management section added
- **Admin Dashboard**: Can be extended for admin file management

## 3. How It Works

### File Upload Process:
1. User selects file and type
2. File uploaded to Supabase Storage in `student-records/{user_id}/` folder
3. File metadata saved to `student_records` table
4. File list updated automatically

### Security Features:
